    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      Your content should reflect factual, research-based information. Companies
      that spread <b>false</b>  or  <b>misleading</b> <br> information are vulnerable to backlash
      from both search engines and consumers.
    </p>
    <h2>Business Goals</h2>
    <p>Think about the business goals you want to accomplish, and how you plan to use content to do this.</p>
    <h2><u>You Should Understand:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What type of content format you need.</li>
        <li>What style/tone you want your piece written in.</li>
        <li>What your goals are for each piece.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Buyer Persona</h2>
    <p>As our guide to creating a buyer persona notes, a buyer persona is an abstract depiction of your ideal customer. <br> It is founded upon qualitative and quantitative data from market/competitor research and existing customer profiles. </p>
        <h2>Search Intent</h2>
        <p> Users often have very different expectations when using search engines, and, in its guidelines,Google talks a lot <br>
            about how to understand what users are looking for when using different queries.Providing exhaustive  <br>
            answers to user queries increases the chances of your content being rated as quality.  
            <p>Search intent can be broken down into four distinct types:</p> 
            <ul>
            <li> <b>Informational</b>- <i>the searcher is looking for specific informaation on a topic</i> </li>
            <li> <b>Navigational</b> - <i>the searcher is looking for a specific web page or site.</i> </li>
            <li> <b>Commercial</b> - <i>the searcher is considering a purchase and wants to investigate their options.</i> </li>
            <li> <b>Transactional</b> - <i>the searcher wants to purchase something.</i> </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Keyword Research and SEO</h2>
    <p>For a business, it’s important to remember that, in today’s digital era,content writing is closely aligned <br>
        with SEO copywriting.Google and other search engines play a vital role in sending organic traffic to <br>
        websites, and they value quality content.</p>
        <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
        <p>In order to effectively engage with your audience and outperform your competition’s marketing initiatives, <br> it helps to construct a comprehensive content strategy plan. This plan refers to how you intend to manage <br>
            your marketing content (i.e. where and when you plan to publish). Your content strategy should include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your content formats <b> (i.e. social media posts, articles, etc.)</b></li>
            <li> The channels you will publish on <b> (i.e. your business website, social media networks, etc.) </b></li>
            <li>How you will manage the content <b>(who will do the posting and manage the customer engagements)</b> </li>
            <li> Content construction <b>(who will actually do the writing? If outsourcing, what firm will you use?)</b></li>
            <li>Content performance <b>(who will analyze how your content is performing and report back to you?)</b></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Topic Research</h3>
        <p>Take the time to carry out thorough topic research, so that you can come up with strong, strategic ideas <br>
            for your content that will resonate with your audience and drive results.</p>
